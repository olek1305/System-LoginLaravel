                    Well, I couldn't think of something better for the project to study.</br>
                    Such a project, it's about me (Arcylisz), I share myself what I'm interested in and who I am.</br>
                    <b> Where did you get such a nickname? </b><br>
                    Earlier I had too bizarre nicknames, I wanted to look for something good nickname for me, 
                    I took a nickname from units from Heroes of Might and Magic III.
